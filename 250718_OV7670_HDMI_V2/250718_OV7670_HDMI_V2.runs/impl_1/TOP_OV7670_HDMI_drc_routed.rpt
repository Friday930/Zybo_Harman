CHECK-3#1 Warning
Report rule limit reached  
REQP-1839 rule limit reached: 20 violations have been found.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_spi_top/U_Debounce/counter_reg_reg[0]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_spi_top/U_Debounce/q_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell u_spi_top/U_Debounce/q_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT u_spi_top/U_Debounce/q_reg[7]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 8 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
u_spi_top/U_Debounce/q_reg_reg[0], u_spi_top/U_Debounce/q_reg_reg[1],
u_spi_top/U_Debounce/q_reg_reg[2], u_spi_top/U_Debounce/q_reg_reg[3],
u_spi_top/U_Debounce/q_reg_reg[4], u_spi_top/U_Debounce/q_reg_reg[5],
u_spi_top/U_Debounce/q_reg_reg[6], u_spi_top/U_Debounce/q_reg_reg[7]
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 u_disp/U_Frame_Buffer/mem_reg_0_0 has an input control pin u_disp/U_Frame_Buffer/mem_reg_0_0/ADDRBWRADDR[14] (net: u_disp/U_Frame_Buffer/mem_reg_1_3_1[14]) which is driven by a register (u_disp/U_VGAController/U_Pix_counter/h_counter_reg[7]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
